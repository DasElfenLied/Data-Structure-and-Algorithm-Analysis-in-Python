# Data-Structure-and-Algorithm-Analysis-in-Python
This project is built according to the book "Data Structure and Algorithm Analysis in C", with python implementation.

I build this project to make myself get more used to python programming, learn data structure and algorithm at the same time. You are warmly welcomed to make commitments to my work, or just fork my work and do some experiment.
